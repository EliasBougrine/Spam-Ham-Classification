    "**Remarks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An accuracy of 75% means that we're only doing slightly better than guessing ham for every email.\n",
    "1. One reason why our classifier isn't great is that the matrix `X_train` has many rows with all 0. That is, the words we've chosen as our features aren't actually present in many of the emails so the classifier can't use them to distinguish between ham/spam emails.\n",
    "1. The false-alarm rate for logistic regression is too high, even at 2%: ideally false-alarms would almost never happen. I might rather wade through thousands of spam emails than get 2% of legitimate emails filtered out of my inbox."

    "Here are some ideas for improving our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!' were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number / percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. We can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, we can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. We can adjust parameters of our model (e.g. the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that we should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, we will likely overfit to our training data.\n"

    "### VI. 1) Precision-Recall Curve\n",

    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
